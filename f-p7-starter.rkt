In this problem you will complete the design of a simple search problem solution
by designing two missing functions. You may need to design a helper or helpers
for those functions.

The analysis of the search tree is in f-p7-figure.pdf. Start by studying that
analysis carefully. Below is the following partially complete program. As you
will see, a lot of work has already been done. In this problem you:
 
  - MUST COMPLETE THE 2 WISH LIST ENTRIES with check-expects, a template
    origin tag, and a working function definition 
  - MAY NOT NEED TO, but are PERMITTED to change the check-expects for
    solve, in case your helpers produce results in a different order.
    The autograder will accept any valid results, independent of their
    order.
  - In our solution we found the primitive function remove useful. Remove
    consumes a value of any type and a list of any type, and removes the
    first occurrence of the value in the list if it exists.  For example:

    (remove 2 (list 3 2 4 2)) -> (list 3 4 2)
    (remove 5 (list 3 2 4 2)) -> (list 3 2 4 2)


NOTE: This problem will be autograded.
      **ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE ESSENTIAL** in your solution.
      Failure to follow these requirements may result in receiving zero marks.

 - the functions you design must conform to the wish list entries
 - you must design the two functions at top-level, with all recipe elements
 - you must include correct @htdf, @signature and @template-origin tags
 - you must not comment out any of the tags
 - your submission must pass the Check Syntax button
 - you must follow all applicable design rules
 - MUST NOT CHANGE the data definitions or example data
 - MUST NOT CHANGE the signature of any function
 - MUST NOT CHANGE the definition of any function for which there
   is already a complete definition
