 A Map is AN OPAQUE DATA STRUCTURE that represents one or more distinct graphs.
 OPAQUE means you can't look inside it.  THE ONLY THING YOU ARE  ALLOWED TO DO
 WITH A MAP IS PASS IT TO generate-node.

 generate-node is defined at the bottom of the file. You should treat it as a
 primitive function described as follows:

 generate-node
 Map Natural -> Node

 If a node with the given number exists in map then produce it.
 Signal an error if no node with the given number exists in the map.

 The bottom of the file defines a map called MAP for the graphs shown in
 this figure:

   https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/exams/2024w1-f/f-p5-6-figure.pdf
 
 But the functions you design must work for any map.

Complete the design of the following function that consumes a MAP, the number
of a start node, and the number of a destination node.

- You function must be tail recursive and you MUST USE THE TAIL RECURSION
  TEMPLATE PROVIDED BELOW.

- You MUST NOT RENAME OR DELETE ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS in the provided template.

- The function should search for the first path it can find from start to
  that only passes through ODD NUMBERED nodes. Note that start and dest must
  be odd numbered nodes as well.

- If it finds such a path it should produce the value of the visited accumulator
  including the destination node number as the first element of the list and the
  start node number as the last element of the list.

NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE TANDEM WORKLISTS. YOU MAY USE ONE IF YOU CHOOSE
BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED AND IT WILL ONLY COMPLICATE YOUR SOLUTION. SINCE TANDEM
WORKLISTS ARE NOT REQUIRED NO EXTRA CREDIT WILL BE AWARDED FOR A TANDEM WORKLIST
SOLUTION.

HINT: Start by using the EXAMPLES STEP OF THE RECIPE. Carefully work through
some examples and be sure you understand why a path accumulator is not required.

We are providing one complex check-expect. You must add others.
