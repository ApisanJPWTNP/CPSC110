# CPSC 110: Introduction to Computation, Programs, and Programming

Welcome to **CPSC 110**! This course introduces fundamental concepts in computer science, focusing on how computation, programming, and design thinking play a vital role across various disciplines such as science, engineering, art, and more. Whether you're a future computer scientist, engineer, or just curious about how computers help solve problems, this course is designed to provide you with the skills and mindset to tackle hard problems systematically.

## Course Overview

Computation and programming are powerful tools that allow us to:

- Organize, store, and analyze data
- Visualize complex information
- Create animations, music, and interactive experiences
- Control devices in our environment
- Develop simulations and computational models

As you progress in your career, you will encounter increasingly complex problems. The major goal of **CPSC 110** is to introduce you to a systematic approach to problem-solving that will serve you well—whether you're tackling design challenges in computer science or addressing difficult problems in other fields.

In the words of a former student:

> "Studying computer science inspired me to think about problems differently and take a more systematic approach to them. Program design is not only relevant to computer science, but to many areas of life. It’s essential for developing strong problem-solving skills."
