(define THICKNESS 2)

#|

Carefully study the explanation in f-p4-figure.pdf, then complete the design
of the function below by writing appropriate tests, the template origin tag,
and the function definition.  

NOTE: This problem will be autograded, and ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE ESSENTIAL
      IN YOUR SOLUTION.  Failure to follow these requirements may result in
      receiving zero marks for this problem.

 - The function you design MUST BE CALLED ray-star.

 - You MUST USE the provided THICKNESS constant.
 
 - You MUST NOT COMMENT out any @ metadata tags.
 
 - You MUST FOLLOW all applicable design rules.
 
 - The file MUST NOT have any errors when the Check Syntax button is pressed.

 - We are providing one check-expect, which you MUST NOT EDIT OR COMMENT OUT.

 - You must add more tests.

 - The function definition MUST call one or more built-in abstract functions.

 - You must define a single top-level function with the given name. You are
   permitted to define helpers, but they must be defined within the top-level
   function using local.

 - The function definition and any helper functions you design MUST NOT be
   recursive.

 - The result of the function must directly be the result of one of the
   built-in abstract functions. So, for example, the following would not
   be a valid function body:

       (define (foo x)
         (empty? (filter ...)))

   This would be a valid function body:

       (define (foo x)
         (local [(define (helper y) (foldr ... ... ...))]
           (helper ...)))
